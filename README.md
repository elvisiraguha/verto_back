## Aditional notes

It is assumed that the batteries are smart, and they will be streaming their location and current capacity. To manually update the battery capacity you can use update battery capacity endpoint above. These data streamed by batteries will help the current holder to know how much capacity left, and the estimated cost for what they have used.

Having a live location of a battery will help the battery holder to locate nearest swapping stations. This migth be an issue of privacy cause by tracking the battery location, the system will be tracking the current battery holder.

It is also assumed that batteries will have following properties set by responsible entities:

- The distance bike can ride on a full battery
- The price for charging a battery from 0% to 100%
